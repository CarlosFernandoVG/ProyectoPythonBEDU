Examples of recent projects include: implementing the ability for restaurants to group tables into different dining areas which customers can decide between when booking a reservation; allowing restaurants to charge a deposit; migrating our services into Kubernetes; and consolidating three similar very large databases to reduce our storage costs.

Our team is highly collaborative: we spend time debating what database architecture to implement for a new feature, or what the right technical solution is to a newly-reported bug. We practice continuous delivery, trunk-based development, code review, and pair programming. Automated testing is also critical for our team.

We know the positive feeling we get when we feel heard, and we reciprocate that deep engagement with others when they're talking or presenting so that we gain alignment and promote our collective actions.

More about Hopper

Despite the pandemic’s impact on the travel industry, Hopper has emerged stronger than ever. As the travel industry continues to rebound, Hopper has demonstrated significant outperformance with its category-leading mobile-only marketplace, delivering value to customers and supply partners with the company’s proprietary suite of fintech offerings .

Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:

Hopper’s valuation is now over $5B, which is more than triple our valuation from early 2020.

The company grew its revenue by more than 300% YoY in 2021. Hopper’s monthly revenues are now 375% higher than its pre-pandemic high point and Hopper Cloud, Hopper’s new B2B initiative, is already 15% of its revenues and growing.

According to Apptopia, Hopper was the #1 most downloaded OTA in the US in 2021. The app has over 70 million downloads.

Hopper’s recovery is faster than the market and its share of the air travel market in North America is now 300% higher than prior to the pandemic, according to MIDT. We are now the 3rd largest air travel agency in North America.

The company sells over $2B in travel and travel related financial services annually.

Hopper’s fintech offerings, such as Price Freeze and Rebooking Guarantee, now represent over 70% of its air revenue.

Hopper Cloud partners include Capital One, Kayak, Marriott, Amadeus, Trip.com , and MakeMyTrip.

The industry opportunity for Hopper Cloud is enormous as projections estimate that if all travel distribution channels offered travel fintech, it could increase the total consumer spend for the sector by $200 billion annually.

And all this recent growth is just the beginning. There are still so many new opportunities we’re excited to tackle in the next year!",Hoteles y complejos turísticos,,2022-09-05T00:00:00,2022-10-16,FULL_TIME
