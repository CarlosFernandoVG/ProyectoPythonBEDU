Content Migration Specialist,Apptegy,Nuevo León,Monterrey,-1,-1,,MXN,"About Apptegy
Since our start in 2015, we’ve gone from a group of individuals to a community pushing toward the same goal of building a fantastic company with great people, great products, and, most importantly, a great culture.

Apptegy is building products to empower school leaders to run better schools. We are building the first marketing platform for schools. Thrillshare, our publishing platform, makes it easy for schools to share positive stories with their communities and the world.
We are growing quickly and are focused on bringing thoughtful, high-performers together to craft amazing products for our clients. We’ve been able to build an exceptional engineering team that cares about their work and each other.
What we’ve built and are building:
Apptegy works with thousands of schools and school districts across the United States. For the past 6 years, we’ve been working on making our technology into a breath of fresh air. School leaders, superintendents and administrators have some of the most stressful and demanding jobs in the world. They are responsible for the safety, well-being, and education of thousands of students. Every day they juggle the roles of politician, disciplinarian, visionary, and accountant.
That’s why we focus on simplicity. By making everything simple, we lower the technical barrier so that any administrator can lead with the most powerful tools available.
In short, we are enabling school leaders to brand, market, and strengthen their schools. Amazing events and happenings occur in schools every day and our technology allows that to be shared across web, mobile, social media, and alerts with a single, simple-to-use tool.
As a Content Migration Specialist you will...
Help schools improve their image and branding by migrating content from existing websites to a new CMS and new websites.Use spreadsheets to track content, changes, and other details.Use HTML to make changes to content and improve content layout.Work quickly and efficiently while keeping quality and design in mind.Motivated by efficiency and constant improvement.

What's true about you?

Self-driven & Always Learning: At Apptegy, we believe that the right people are intrinsically motivated. We have built a team of engineers that enjoy learning and take that responsibility seriously. Whether they are starting out on their career or well into their experience, they are still looking to improve on their weaknesses and to use their strengths to help others.
In short, they are naturally motivated to do meaningful work and they own their learning experience.
To quote one experienced engineer who joined Apptegy in 2020, “People here are like some sort of crack squad of commandos. They are running into what needs doing and doing it. They’re more likely to do too much than too little. This is an excellent team.”
Speak up: In some companies, people have to wait their turn to speak up. You have to have a minimum number of years of experience to have a voice at the table. Or if you’re an expert on your topic, you need to hold off until you’ve gained the trust of the veteran employees.
At Apptegy, you have a voice from the start. Some of the best ideas have come from junior people that see things differently. We want the best ideas to win— no matter who it comes from. And those times when the best idea comes from someone else are an opportunity for you to learn and to increase your learning process.
What else should I know?
We take our responsibility as a company seriously and aim to make this the best job that you’ve had (and one that sets you up for future success). We want your day at work and your time at home to be a joyful experience that’s why we provide:
