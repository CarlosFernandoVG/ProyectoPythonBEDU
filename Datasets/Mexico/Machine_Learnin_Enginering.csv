We Are Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re ""old"" (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do - you can’t put us in a box!
But ""Digital Transformation"" is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

Software Engineer (Distributed Systems/Golang/Kubernetes),Pachyderm,Jalisco,Guadalajara,-1,-1,,MXN,"About Pachyderm:

Pachyderm is the leader in data versioning and pipelines for MLOps. We're building the data foundation that allows data science teams to automate and scale their machine learning lifecycle while guaranteeing reproducibility. With over $40 million in three rounds of funding from leading investors like Benchmark, Microsoft M12, and Y Combinator, Pachyderm is committed to building industrial strength capabilities for Data Centric AI. Pachyderm offers a commercial Enterprise Edition and an open source Community Edition. Pachyderm helps customers get their ML and AI projects to market faster, lower data processing and storage costs, and supports strict data governance requirements.

Pachyderm is growing fast and still small, so joining means you are getting in right at the ground floor and that you will have an enormous impact on the success and direction of the company and product. Pachyderm has always and will always embrace a ""Remote-first"" approach to growing our team. This allows us to hire a diverse group of individuals across the country (and world!) while giving our team members the flexibility to work from anywhere. Being a member of The Pach means joining a supportive team that cares about you, values kindness and works hard to create an open and transparent workplace.

The Role

Love Docker, Golang, and distributed systems?

Pachyderm is hiring distributed systems engineers to help us build out the core product - a distributed version-controlled filesystem and data processing engine. You'll be solving hard algorithmic and distributed systems problems every day and building a first-of-its-kind, containerized, data infrastructure platform.

While your primary focus will of course be building the core product, you'll also have direct exposure to users and enterprise customers via our open source support channels. At Pachyderm, OSS user and customer feedback is major driver of our product roadmap and we believe that everyone within the company should experience that first-hand.

Pachyderm is just a small team right now, so you'd be getting in right at the ground floor and have an enormous impact on the success and direction of the company and product. You can of course check out the product on GitHub because it's open-source.

We offer significant equity, full benefits, and all the usual startup perks.

Qualifications:
2+ years of experience working in distributed systems, data infrastructure, back-end systems or related development work.
Major contribution to prominent and related open-source projects are a plus or can be a replacement for work experience in some circumstances (e.g. You've been a student just finishing your degree)
While it is a bonus, experience with Golang is not a strict requirement. Programming languages are just part of your arsenal and we've found that great engineers have no problem learning new tools.
Must have strong communication skills when talking about technical concepts. Our interview process strongly tests for communication as we have a very collaborative work environment where many parts of the codebase interact in complex ways.
Things change quickly as our product develops and breaking down major features into smaller and more easily executable PRs is an imperative skill.

Benefits:

Significant equity, 401k and full benefits (100% medical, dental and vision for employees, 50% for all dependents).
Flexible PTO - work/life balance is important and we want you to take time off to rejuvenate!
Remote friendly- we were remote before remote was cool and we intend to continue to invest in a remote first culture.
Tons of fun swag and surprise packages sent to your doorstep.
Tech and office stipends - what you buy is yours to keep.
Education and donation stipends - we want to support your career growth and the community.
Supportive parental leave (see also: work/life balance).
Encouraged fun - game days, fun activities, zoom hangouts and more (and - when responsible - visits to our home base for team on-sites)

We can't wait to meet you and hope you'll join our PACH!",,,2022-08-23T00:00:00,2022-10-15,OTHER

Our products generate and process large amounts of data from sensors, on-board models, and control algorithms in real-time creating real-world machine usage information. Electronic Components/Platforms are key enabling technologies for the overall digital strategy. Key electronic component technologies provide the foundational technology building blocks that enable valuable data to be gathered from machines and engines.
Job Purpose: Develop high-quality electronic/electrical component product lines for engine and machine systems that meet complex requirements and low-cost producer (LCP) targets. Partner with suppliers to deliver production components and help the systems engineers integrate successfully into various applications. This is the third career level in engineering and represents a shift from learning and assisting to fully contributing in assignments that are broader, more complex, and challenging in nature.
The Electronic Components/Platforms Engineer position develops, improves, and troubleshoots electronic/electrical hardware used in an array of engine and machine systems. This generally includes the development of product requirements, analysis and simulation, electronic component selection, schematic/layout development, and platform verification and validation.

We Are Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
