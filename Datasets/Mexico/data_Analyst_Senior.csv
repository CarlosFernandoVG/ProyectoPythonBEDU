Senior Product Analyst,Nuvocargo,México,Ciudad de México,-1,-1,,MXN,"Nuvocargo is reinventing the $2 trillion freight forwarding industry. We are a digital-first freight forwarder using a mix of technology and exceptional service to help companies seamlessly move products across the Americas, starting with the biggest trade lane in the world: Mexico <-> USA cross-border trucking. We were ranked #2 on Fast Company's most innovative companies in 2022 and as a Y Combinator Top Company and are looking for top talent to embrace this adventure.
The opportunity for you:

Data drives Nuvocargo! We're looking for rockstar analytical talent to help us create the future of staking. As a product analyst, you'll be a key strategic partner to the product team and lead the way for key strategic initiatives. You'll shine the light on everything from key business KPIs and metrics and product usage to protocol risk and understanding.

You will not just answer questions but direct us to ask the right questions. Questions and insights that will steer us to win. You care about the customer, product usability, market share, combining business and user value to build a truly compelling product experience.

You'll collaborate with our world-class EPD team led by veterans who have held senior product and engineering positions early on at companies like Dropbox ($10B+) and Common (raised $100m+)to shape the direction of our shipper offering and internal tools in an industry where the average customer NPS is negative or very low, and where most internal processes do not rely on modern software tools to unlock revenue growth and a superior customer experience.

Who are you?
You are the data pioneer at Nuvocargo. As the first product analyst hired, you should have a robust knowledge of consumer lifecycle and behavior analysis, customer segmentation, end-to-end funnel analysis, and business operations.
You have at least 5 years of experience working as a Product analyst or data scientist. You have a track record of helping cross-functional product teams identify and prioritize analytics needs and experimentation opportunities that will deliver high-quality, data-driven insights in a timely manner using the appropriate methodologies
You have a strong technical background.
Expertise with tools used for analysis, visualization, and dashboarding, such as Looker, Amplitude, and Hex.
Experience using statistical techniques, particularly in terms of experimentation and A/B testing
You have advanced SQL Skills. Experience building aggregates and optimizing data workstreams
Experience accessing and manipulating database data using Python preferred
You move with speed. You move incredibly fast, making decisions and overcoming obstacles with speed. You can ruthlessly prioritize and make speedy decisions considering qualitative and quantitative data, user needs, business goals, and company resources.
You create structure out of ambiguity. Logistics is a complex industry with multiple stakeholders involved in every transaction. You will thrive here if you can extract structured insights and determine product priorities by merely observing and conversing with our stakeholders.
You are both a great communicator and listener. You are great at synthesizing inputs from different sources; you speak and write clearly, concisely, and with a structure that gets everyone on the same page when things feel messy.
This will NOT be a good fit for you if:
You love to ideate, but you don't love to do it. We expect you to make things happen by combining a strategic mindset with a bias towards action.
You have a fixed mindset. We have an entrepreneurial culture and look for a self-starter who can readily acknowledge mistakes, own them, fix them, and learn from them in short cycles.
You want to work with only ""tech"" folks. Modernizing an industry like logistics requires patience and empathy; you need to be excited about surprising and delighting stakeholders that come from a world outside of Silicon Valley.
What you'll do in a typical week:
Partner with Product Engineering and product managers, understand goals, craft critical metrics, and measure ongoing performance.
Inform future experimentation design and roadmaps by performing exploratory analysis to understand user engagement behavior and derive insights
Identify key trends and build executive-facing dashboards to track the progress of acquisition, monetization, and engagement trends.
Develop a deep understanding of the product; define the key metrics to guide the team in the early phases of identifying product market fit.
Own data analysis and visualization, and communicate the outcomes/insights to various stakeholders to aid strategic decisions for improvements in the international logistic process.

Nuvocargo works constantly with external consultants to pay fairly across all our geographies. The salary offered for this position is: $70,000 MXN Gross per month.


Eligible Benefits Offered:

Medical Insurance
Dental Insurance
Vision Insurance
Life Insurance
Generous Time Away
Participation in the Employee Stock Option Program

What we offer:

A unique & fun culture at the intersection of the freight and technology industries as well as between the USA and Latin American work cultures.
Above market salary, benefits, and a robust employee stock ownership program to make you an owner and partner of the business.
A chance to join the ground floor of a well-funded, fast-growing startup that is modernizing a trillion dollar industry critical to the global economy.

Nuvocargo is an equal opportunity employer. We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees.
More about Nuvocargo:

International logistics is the multi-trillion dollar connective tissue of the world economy, but it's been slow to leverage the power of technology; it's finally going digital, and Nuvocargo is playing a big role in driving this historic shift.

We believe that true expertise in logistics cannot be automated and is incredibly valuable; however, we think software and technology can give logistics professionals superpowers to help provide shippers with the best service, and make everyone's lives easier.

We're growing quickly, and are backed by some of the world's best investors from both Silicon Valley and Latin America such as Tiger Global Management, The Flexport Fund, QED (founders of $60B+ Capital One), NFX (Silicon Valley fund with $10bn in exits), the founders of Nubank ($30B+), Loft ($3B+), Ramp ($2B+), and Rappi ($5B+), Y Combinator (~1% acceptance rate, created $300bn worth of startups), and angels who have built, exited, or currently sit on the board of companies worth over $100 billion.

Our DNA is comprised of four very distinct worlds and cultures: Silicon Valley, Logistics, Latin America, and USA. We are at the intersection of these worlds and laying the foundations for hyper-growth at one of the most tech-forward 3PL's in both the US and Mexico.
