More about Hopper

Despite the pandemic’s impact on the travel industry, Hopper has emerged stronger than ever. As the travel industry continues to rebound, Hopper has demonstrated significant outperformance with its category-leading mobile-only marketplace, delivering value to customers and supply partners with the company’s proprietary suite of fintech offerings .

Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:

Hopper’s valuation is now over $5B, which is more than triple our valuation from early 2020.

The company grew its revenue by more than 300% YoY in 2021. Hopper’s monthly revenues are now 375% higher than its pre-pandemic high point and Hopper Cloud, Hopper’s new B2B initiative, is already 15% of its revenues and growing.

According to Apptopia, Hopper was the #1 most downloaded OTA in the US in 2021. The app has over 70 million downloads.

Hopper’s recovery is faster than the market and its share of the air travel market in North America is now 300% higher than prior to the pandemic, according to MIDT. We are now the 3rd largest air travel agency in North America.

The company sells over $2B in travel and travel related financial services annually.

Hopper’s fintech offerings, such as Price Freeze and Rebooking Guarantee, now represent over 70% of its air revenue.

Given the success of its travel fintech, Hopper recently launched a B2B initiative called Hopper Cloud, where any travel provider can unlock a totally unique revenue stream by seamlessly integrating and offering Hopper’s travel content and fintech products. Hopper Cloud partners include Capital One, Kayak, Marriott, Amadeus, Trip.com , and MakeMyTrip.

Kantar is home to some of the world’s leading research, data, and insights brands. We go beyond the obvious - with intelligence, passion, and creativity - to discover new directions, set strategies and plan actions that inspire extraordinary success.
We are looking for a creative, self-motivated, highly numerically skilled person for a Sr. Data Scientist position in the Analytics Center of Excellence in Latin America based in Mexico City.
Candidates must satisfy the following requirements:
+5.5 years’ experience in Analytics, Data Science, Statistics, or a data-related-position.
A finished degree in Applied Mathematics, Physics, Computer Science, Engineering, or an equivalent qualification with a statistical background, modelling savvy, and the desire to learn new statistical techniques. We need you to know what to do given a bunch of numbers.
Strong computing and programming skills in R or Python. The bunch of numbers is going to be a big bunch! We need you to be able to deal with it.
Having led a team is a bonus.
Creative mindset – willingness to go beyond the textbook while applying statistics in a business situation which typically entails less-than-ideal data quality/ quantity.
You can lead the preparation of high-quality outputs in line with the statement of work and client need.
You deliver high quality projects, on time, with client impact. You can take analysis through to conclusions, inputs into recommendations and implications for the client.
You can picture yourself talking every day to clients about business questions from scratch, questions about previous and current projects.
You feel comfortable coordinating large-size projects where you can delegate specific tasks.
You’re more than ok with the administrative tasks of the projects, ensuring they are run within budget, and you look to continually improve efficiency.
You can build positive client relationships that enable project success and impact. You can take an active role in client interactions.
You can coach high performing specialists-teams: Senior Analysts / Analysts / Trainee Analysts - to deliver excellence in analytics.
You can manage to develop and support the skills/knowledge of others, providing “actionable” feedback and driving accountability.
Interest in developing data visualisation dashboards (ideally in Shiny, Spotfire or Tableau but no previous knowledge is required). Once you worked out the numbers, we need you to be able to show the result in a decent way.
Fluency in both English and Spanish is a must. The ability to communicate efficiently difficult concepts to non-specialists is essential.
Being a team player. The team is divided in offices all over Latin America and sometimes work is done with teams in other regions. We need you to work with somebody you have never met and far far away.
Likes being challenged. You need to laugh in the face of danger.
Fun is guaranteed.

More about Hopper

Despite the pandemic’s impact on the travel industry, Hopper has emerged stronger than ever. As the travel industry continues to rebound, Hopper has demonstrated significant outperformance with its category-leading mobile-only marketplace, delivering value to customers and supply partners with the company’s proprietary suite of fintech offerings .

Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:

Hopper’s valuation is now over $5B, which is more than triple our valuation from early 2020.

The company grew its revenue by more than 300% YoY in 2021. Hopper’s monthly revenues are now 375% higher than its pre-pandemic high point and Hopper Cloud, Hopper’s new B2B initiative, is already 15% of its revenues and growing.

According to Apptopia, Hopper was the #1 most downloaded OTA in the US in 2021. The app has over 70 million downloads.

Hopper’s recovery is faster than the market and its share of the air travel market in North America is now 300% higher than prior to the pandemic, according to MIDT. We are now the 3rd largest air travel agency in North America.

The company sells over $2B in travel and travel related financial services annually.

Hopper’s fintech offerings, such as Price Freeze and Rebooking Guarantee, now represent over 70% of its air revenue.

Given the success of its travel fintech, Hopper recently launched a B2B initiative called Hopper Cloud, where any travel provider can unlock a totally unique revenue stream by seamlessly integrating and offering Hopper’s travel content and fintech products. Hopper Cloud partners include Capital One, Kayak, Marriott, Amadeus, Trip.com , and MakeMyTrip.

The industry opportunity for Hopper Cloud is enormous as projections estimate that if all travel distribution channels offered travel fintech, it could increase the total consumer spend for the sector by $200 billion annually.

And all this recent growth is just the beginning. There are still so many new opportunities we’re excited to tackle in the next year!",Hoteles y complejos turísticos,,2022-09-08T00:00:00,2022-10-16,FULL_TIME

"Senior Android Engineer, Mexico",Square,México,Ciudad de México,-1,-1,,MXN,"Company Description

Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.

Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.


There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.

You'll implement management’s roadmap and strategy decisions and will play a critical role in helping the team accomplish our industry-leading growth goals.
Our team is focused, fast-moving, and rapidly growing with an abundance of growth and impact opportunities. We focus on building the best tools to help our merchants close sales and get paid quickly, anywhere, at any time. At the same time, we are doing this in an efficient and scalable way, making smart choices about how to automate critical functions for our merchants.
As a mobile engineer on the Invoices team, you will work within Square’s Point of Sale codebase and have the ability to impact all of the apps in our ecosystem, including our Invoices app.

We are a digital-first freight forwarder using a mix of technology and exceptional service to help companies seamlessly move products across the Americas, starting with the biggest trade lane in the world: Mexico <-> USA cross-border trucking. We were ranked #2 on Fast Company's most innovative companies in 2022 and as a Y Combinator Top Company and are looking for top talent to embrace this adventure.
The opportunity for you:

Data drives Nuvocargo! We're looking for rockstar analytical talent to help us create the future of staking. As a product analyst, you'll be a key strategic partner to the product team and lead the way for key strategic initiatives. You'll shine the light on everything from key business KPIs and metrics and product usage to protocol risk and understanding.

You will not just answer questions but direct us to ask the right questions. Questions and insights that will steer us to win. You care about the customer, product usability, market share, combining business and user value to build a truly compelling product experience.

You'll collaborate with our world-class EPD team led by veterans who have held senior product and engineering positions early on at companies like Dropbox ($10B+) and Common (raised $100m+)to shape the direction of our shipper offering and internal tools in an industry where the average customer NPS is negative or very low, and where most internal processes do not rely on modern software tools to unlock revenue growth and a superior customer experience.

Who are you?
You are the data pioneer at Nuvocargo. As the first product analyst hired, you should have a robust knowledge of consumer lifecycle and behavior analysis, customer segmentation, end-to-end funnel analysis, and business operations.
You have at least 5 years of experience working as a Product analyst or data scientist. You have a track record of helping cross-functional product teams identify and prioritize analytics needs and experimentation opportunities that will deliver high-quality, data-driven insights in a timely manner using the appropriate methodologies
You have a strong technical background.
Expertise with tools used for analysis, visualization, and dashboarding, such as Looker, Amplitude, and Hex.
Experience using statistical techniques, particularly in terms of experimentation and A/B testing
You have advanced SQL Skills. Experience building aggregates and optimizing data workstreams
Experience accessing and manipulating database data using Python preferred
You move with speed. You move incredibly fast, making decisions and overcoming obstacles with speed. You can ruthlessly prioritize and make speedy decisions considering qualitative and quantitative data, user needs, business goals, and company resources.
You create structure out of ambiguity. Logistics is a complex industry with multiple stakeholders involved in every transaction. You will thrive here if you can extract structured insights and determine product priorities by merely observing and conversing with our stakeholders.
You are both a great communicator and listener. You are great at synthesizing inputs from different sources; you speak and write clearly, concisely, and with a structure that gets everyone on the same page when things feel messy.
This will NOT be a good fit for you if:
You love to ideate, but you don't love to do it. We expect you to make things happen by combining a strategic mindset with a bias towards action.
You have a fixed mindset. We have an entrepreneurial culture and look for a self-starter who can readily acknowledge mistakes, own them, fix them, and learn from them in short cycles.
You want to work with only ""tech"" folks. Modernizing an industry like logistics requires patience and empathy; you need to be excited about surprising and delighting stakeholders that come from a world outside of Silicon Valley.
What you'll do in a typical week:
Partner with Product Engineering and product managers, understand goals, craft critical metrics, and measure ongoing performance.
Inform future experimentation design and roadmaps by performing exploratory analysis to understand user engagement behavior and derive insights
Identify key trends and build executive-facing dashboards to track the progress of acquisition, monetization, and engagement trends.
Develop a deep understanding of the product; define the key metrics to guide the team in the early phases of identifying product market fit.
Own data analysis and visualization, and communicate the outcomes/insights to various stakeholders to aid strategic decisions for improvements in the international logistic process.

Nuvocargo works constantly with external consultants to pay fairly across all our geographies. The salary offered for this position is: $70,000 MXN Gross per month.


Eligible Benefits Offered:

Medical Insurance
Dental Insurance
Vision Insurance
Life Insurance
Generous Time Away
Participation in the Employee Stock Option Program

What we offer:

A unique & fun culture at the intersection of the freight and technology industries as well as between the USA and Latin American work cultures.
Above market salary, benefits, and a robust employee stock ownership program to make you an owner and partner of the business.
A chance to join the ground floor of a well-funded, fast-growing startup that is modernizing a trillion dollar industry critical to the global economy.

Nuvocargo is an equal opportunity employer. We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees.
More about Nuvocargo:

International logistics is the multi-trillion dollar connective tissue of the world economy, but it's been slow to leverage the power of technology; it's finally going digital, and Nuvocargo is playing a big role in driving this historic shift.

We believe that true expertise in logistics cannot be automated and is incredibly valuable; however, we think software and technology can give logistics professionals superpowers to help provide shippers with the best service, and make everyone's lives easier.

We're growing quickly, and are backed by some of the world's best investors from both Silicon Valley and Latin America such as Tiger Global Management, The Flexport Fund, QED (founders of $60B+ Capital One), NFX (Silicon Valley fund with $10bn in exits), the founders of Nubank ($30B+), Loft ($3B+), Ramp ($2B+), and Rappi ($5B+), Y Combinator (~1% acceptance rate, created $300bn worth of startups), and angels who have built, exited, or currently sit on the board of companies worth over $100 billion.

Our DNA is comprised of four very distinct worlds and cultures: Silicon Valley, Logistics, Latin America, and USA. We are at the intersection of these worlds and laying the foundations for hyper-growth at one of the most tech-forward 3PL's in both the US and Mexico.
