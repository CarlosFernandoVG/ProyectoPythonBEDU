Grammarly team members in this role must be based in the United States or Canada.

The opportunity

Grammarly empowers people to thrive and connect, whenever and wherever they communicate. Every day, 30 million people and 30,000 teams around the world use our AI-powered writing assistant. All of this begins with our team collaborating in a values-driven and learning-oriented environment.

Until now, our product has provided a largely uniform, identical experience to all its users. As we strive to define and dominate the communication-assistant market, it’s become essential for our product to deliver a context-driven and personalized experience to every user. This necessitates understanding users’ intent, style, and communication preferences.

We are looking for a Machine Learning Engineer specializing in recommendation, relevance, or personalization to build these capabilities. The person in this role will leverage customers’ implicit and explicit feedback and interactions to help advance the product. They will apply ML to solve new and challenging problems, as well as build the infrastructure and systems to operate solutions effectively at scale. This will involve working on a highly cross-functional team, in close partnership with Analytical Linguists, Computational Linguists, Data Scientists, and more.

Grammarly’s ML practitioners have the freedom to innovate and uncover breakthroughs—and, in turn, influence our product roadmap. They will have the chance to broaden and deepen their skills in machine learning and deep learning. Read more about our stack or hear from our team on our technical blog.
