Senior Full Stack Engineer (Toronto or Vancouver Hub - Remote),Barley,British Columbia,Vancouver,-1,-1,,CAD,"About Barley

Compensation accounts for up to 70% of an organization’s total operating costs, yet the processes and tools used to determine who gets paid what, why, and how is still painfully convoluted and manual. How is this possible? Believe it or not, most companies are still using a dizzying amount of spreadsheets that ultimately leaves leadership guessing and the employees puzzled or worse yet, unfairly compensated.
Barley is a venture-backed startup focused on building solutions for a vast array of compensation challenges (from managing salary bands to conducting pay equity analysis). With Barley’s Compensation Management platform, our goal is to empower organizations to make better pay decisions.
Remote-First Across Two Hiring Hubs: Barley is a remote-first company that supports a flexible approach to work. Our team is co-located across two hiring hubs (Toronto and Vancouver). While we all predominately work remotely (i.e. work from home) , we offer dedicated offices in both Toronto and Vancouver so that our team can collaborate and come together in-person, as desired.
