The analysis you will be asked to do will be like nothing you have ever done before! These are some actual questions that the team has investigated recently:

How much more effective are customer support agents in organizations that have enabled our Ai features?
Can we identify existing customers who might be willing to be beta testers for our new Spanish speech recognition?
What are some improvements we could make to our Australian English speech recognition?
Why do our metrics show that Australian English speakers are both happier and more frustrated?
Using customer ratings of our transcripts, can we identify USA regions that we should focus on improving?
How often do customers call a call centre and then call again with the same issue?
Does the amount of time a customer is put on hold affect their rating of the customer service experience?

Data Engineer,Local Logic,,,-1,-1,,CAD,"Our Mission
Local Logic is digitizing the built world to make it universally understandable and actionable for consumers, investors, developers, and governments with the ambition of helping build cities that are more sustainable and equitable for the people that live in them.
To achieve that dream, we’ve built a digital twin of cities, quantifying the built world using data and AI to interpret the $217T real estate market throughout the US and Canada.
We started our journey at McGill University’s urban planning department, where we came to see that cities were being developed in all kinds of unsustainable ways. Why were sprawling suburbs still being built, when doing so would increase pollution and inequality? Why were new business parks being built far from mass transit, when doing so would make traffic congestion skyrocket? Why was social housing being built in places that would exacerbate social problems rather than improve them?
It became clear to us why: cities are incredibly difficult to understand. But we realized that with recent advances in data science, all the complexity of cities could be made simple enough for anyone to understand. And that understanding would be essential to making the sustainable, equitable, and prosperous cities that we so desperately need.
Today, Local Logic delivers sophisticated location insights through webtools, APIs, one-click reports and a data analytics platform. Our insights are powered by billions of data points we’ve generated that describe all aspects of cities - from the distance to the nearest bus stop, the quietness on a street, to the most recent trends in the housing market and more.
Your Mission
As a Data Engineer, you’ll be joining the team responsible for building Local Logic’s next generation cloud intelligence platform that is used to create our location-based insights and predictions from large and diverse sources of data. The platform delivers value to our customers through APIs, some exposed externally, and some consumed by our Analytics Platform and our team of data scientists.
You believe in our mission and want to help us achieve it. You bring your own unique perspective to the team, so you can challenge the way we do things for the better. You’re able to speak up when you disagree, ask questions when you don’t understand, and take ownership of your work.
We’re a remote-enabled company, so if you want to work remotely once a week, twice a week, or five days a week, you’ll have all the necessary tools and support you need to do so.
As A Data Engineer, Your Responsibilities Will Include:
With your incredible technical skills, providing technical leadership and contributing to building our next generation intelligence platform
Playing a central role in designing and building Local Logic’s cloud-based big data pipelines - we’re processing billions of data points per month
Using your experience to guide the design and implementation of our data architecture, helping the team make the right tradeoffs to balance cost, scalability and performance
Mentoring and coaching more junior developers
Key Requirements:
Strong experience of ETL and generally experience with designing, building, and maintaining data pipelines and maintaining a large scale data ecosystem
5+ years of software development experience; startup industry experience is a plus
Solid programming skills in Python, or other languages such as Scala, Java, etc.
