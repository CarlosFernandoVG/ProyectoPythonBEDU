Praemo is searching for creative technical people to help improve Razor™. We do not require you to have all the qualifications listed in the following job description. A lot of what we do can be learned on the job. If this position sounds interesting to you, we strongly encourage you to apply!

About Praemo

Founded by industry experts, Praemo is focused on the appropriate application of leading-edge analytic technologies within industrial operations. We believe there is a simpler more effective way to harvest insights from the industrial and manufacturing datasets that already exist.

Utilizing an organization’s operational and IoT (Internet of Things) data as-is, where-is, and applying statistical, machine learning, and AI tools, Razor transforms existing and under-utilized data into context-relevant actionable insights. These insights alert industrial operators to any anomalous behavior with the potential to harm performance in time to prevent an incident. Due to the generalized nature of Razor, it can be applied to a wide range of datasets.

Praemo has worked with customer datasets that range from discrete manufacturing to consumer-packaged goods to mining and processing plants.

The Praemo head office is located in downtown Kitchener, Ontario, Canada. We are looking for an energetic applicant with general knowledge of Linux & Python to help us out. If you thrive in an autonomous, empowering, and exciting environment, and have a strong desire to learn and investigate new technologies, we want to hear from you!

About the Tech Team

The Tech Team is divided into two interacting branches: Product Development and Emerging Applications. The Product Development team focuses on the development of Razor and Razor’s model suite while the Emerging Applications team monitors the application of Razor to new customer data and develops new analytical approaches for emerging use cases. Both teams collaborate regularly to drive the product forward.

Successful Tech Team members are:

Adaptable
Hard-working
Motivated and self-starting
Creative
Can think critically about their code as well as the team’s
Can handle ambiguity

Overall, the Tech Team is dynamic with opportunities for everyone to contribute in a variety of ways. We run both Product Development and Emerging Applications Tech Teams as matrix organizations. Each team member is responsible for their own projects, with the entire team available for brainstorming and mentoring. We feel this structure allows you the freedom to create without the burden of micromanagement. We encourage taking ping-pong or coffee breaks and using all paid time off – a rested mind is an efficient mind!

The tech team also has plenty of opportunities to grow in whichever capacity you’re looking for. Want to upskill? Great! We have annual support for continuing education. Want to take on more responsibility and improve those leadership skills? Praemo will support your ambitions. Want to dip your feet in another team’s pool and learn something new? We’ll make it work! Want to see how many donuts you can eat in a day? Same. We’re in this together

About your role

At Praemo, the Tech Team works with data at massive scales and drives the development of our products. We work closely with our sales department and customers to shape the ongoing development of Razor. As a Data Scientist, you will have a direct impact on both our customers’ bottom line and our own.

Through model and utility development for Razor you will help provide actionable insights across all customers’ processes. In addition to your day-to-day tasks, you will also be expected to gain experience with the global system by contributing to other team-members’ projects in the form of code-review and brainstorming.

Responsibilities:

Build statistical or machine learning based solutions (descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, or prescriptive) while maintaining a generalized customer-centric point-of-view
Work closely with and incorporate feedback from internal Data Science and Sales teams

Please *quantify the impact* of your accomplishments. What was the outcome and impact that it had? How much did you personally contribute to the success of a project or task?3. e.g. Saying ""made the web server fast"" is not specific.4. Saying ""Increased server performance from 2 Requests Per Second (RPS) to 4,000 RPS"" is more specific. But _how_ did you do it?5. Saying ""Implemented redis LRU caching and optimized top 5 database queries to improve server performance from 2 RPS to 4,000 RPS"" - great! Now we know specifically what you did, and the impact it had. Fantastic.6. Please stack-rank your accomplishments so the best, most important, most impactful items are at the top.
