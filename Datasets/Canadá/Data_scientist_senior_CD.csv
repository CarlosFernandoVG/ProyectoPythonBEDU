Reddit is a community of communities where people can dive into anything through experiences built around their interests, hobbies, and passions. With more than 50 million people visiting 100,000+ communities daily, it is home to the most open and authentic conversations on the internet. From pets to parenting, skincare to stocks, there's a community for everybody on Reddit. For more information, visit redditinc.com.
We are looking for a Data Scientist to work with our Ads Brand Safety & Billing product teams. You will partner closely with cross functional team members such as Product Managers, Engineers, Designers, etc. in utilizing data to drive product decision and strategy. In addition to strong analytical skills, you will have an interest in data quality and collaborating with engineers to ensure we have the data we need to assess product performance.

Reddit is continuing to grow our teams with the best talent. We're completely remote friendly and will continue to be after the pandemic.

How You'll Have Impact:

Advertising is Reddit's primary business model and we have an ambitious goal to turn it into a massive business. Although several large digital ad platforms already exist, advertisers are being increasingly drawn to Reddit because of our passionate communities that drive action. This large number of self-governed communities have highly-engaged users who are in an unduplicated mindset of consuming relevant information. This has created the opportunity for Reddit to build a massive and highly differentiated ads business.

We have spent the past few years building the foundations of a modern ad serving system, building features to help brand and performance advertisers find their audiences on Reddit and get high ROI on their ad spend. We're now ready to build differentiated products on top of those foundations, utilizing data to drive the product decisions for both short term and long term bets.

As a data scientist on the ads data team you'll be a key player in ensuring we make the right product decisions based on data insights, play with the large data from one of the largest websites, and help define the culture and frameworks for future team members. Reddit sits in a unique place, where there are still a lot of low hanging fruit opportunities that will immediately impact millions of users and thousands of advertisers.

What You'll Learn:

You will partner closely with our Ads Product and Engineering team, which is the core driver of revenue for the company. You'll play a key role in developing Ads product strategy and experiments. You'll play with petabytes of data full of user and advertiser interactions to develop a deeper understanding of Reddit's ads ecosystem.
In addition, you will work side by side with a world-class org of Engineering, ML, Search, Data Science, Data Warehouse, and Analytics practitioners who work together to create a variety of capabilities for Reddit to be more successful in its decision-making and product creation. In this process, you will be exposed to a variety of new techniques in experimentation, statistical frameworks, machine learning, deep learning, and causal inference.

What You'll Do:

Analyze conversations and behaviors across Reddit's 10,000 interest-based communities, and convert them into insights and product recommendations.
Understand Reddit advertising and help the company improve Ads Revenue while simultaneously improving ROAS (Return on Ads Spend) for advertisers.
Conduct product/feature analyses, opportunity sizing, experimentation (A/B testing) and build dashboards/visualizations to assess product health.
Organize data by designing table schemas, data pipelines, aggregations, alerts and general data infrastructure for the Ads Organization.
Collaborate with various cross-functional stakeholders, including Product Managers, Engineers, Designers, UX Researchers, Data Engineers and Data Warehouse Engineers to lead projects related to organizing and analyzing data.
Be an integral part of the Data Org, leveraging and contributing to the vibrant knowledge base, shared across a community of world-class data experts.

Who You Might Be:

2+ years of experience in data analytics or related quantitative role
Demonstrated ability to influence and guide product strategy with data
Demonstrated ability to take ambiguous problems and solve them in a structured, hypothesis-driven, data-supported way
Desire to mentor other data scientists and share best practices to elevate the data science practice at Reddit
Strong ability to communicate and discuss complex topics with technical & non-technical audiences
Proficiency with relational database (e.g., SQL) and statistical analysis/programming languages (e.g., R / Python)
Proficiency with dashboarding tools (e.g. Mode Analytics, Tableau, Looker)

Senior Data Scientist,Myant,Ontario,Etobicoke,-1,-1,,CAD,"About Us:
At Myant, we are creating the world’s first expressive and continuous digital presence platform, enabled by integrating technology directly into clothing and augmented by other devices, wearables, and IOT. We see the evolution of society where every member gets to participate from anywhere and anytime through a whole-body experience, mostly in a passive or ambient manner to foster ubiquitous accessibility. Humans have a fundamental desire and need to be connected to our environment, family, community and technology. This level of connection will create a paradigm shift in the way we deal with each other, especially from afar, allowing for more meaningful relationships, and more in-depth representation of ourselves.
The need for this type of connection is not new. There are many companies working on ways to connect humans in singularity with technology, however most of these technologies are based on devices that are often used in episodical ways hence, leading to poor adoption or reliability. In general, innovation and technology have delivered significant benefits for many members of society however, there are those who are left behind, namely the very young, the marginalized, the old and the sick. The challenge of inclusion for those left behind requires us to move beyond device focused strategies, towards an interface that we use naturally, every day. We believe that textile is that primary interface, used in clothing, coverings, carpeting and more, we wear and are surrounded by textiles universally, at all times.
Such an interface could fuse data with other devices that we use periodically and data with other IoTs in the environment. People could then leverage their physical presence over their digital presence to communicate and share personal wellbeing. This could unlock healthcare that is proactive and preventative, social connectedness that is more profound, enable care distribution models to be seamless and on demand, better fitness insights, safer working environments and more.
The vision for SKIIN -our first consumer-facing brand- is to enhance human ability through connected clothing and textiles. Skiin is in beta-phase market launch and has been recently granted Health Canada medical device license and submitted to FDA for regulatory approval in the US market. The sensors and actuators embedded within our apparel create your Digital Identity, which will be consumed by those who matter to you - your family members, physicians, trainers, other IoT devices - without you consciously having to think about it. The line between the digital and physical world is becoming increasingly blurry and we believe textile is the next medium to bridge that gap.
We are a multi-disciplinary technology team solving big challenges at the intersection of fashion, electronics, software, and data science.

Amazon's Sponsored Products advertising business is one of the fastest growing areas in the company. Have you ever wondered what happens behind that “Sponsored” label you see in search results on Amazon? Hint: it involves a lot of interesting tech delivered by a great team.


The Sponsored Products Marketplace team optimizes the systems and ad placements to match demand with supply using a combination of data-driven product innovation, machine learning, big data analytics, and low latency/high-volume engineering. By the time organic search results are ready, we've processed all of the potential ads and determined which ones are going to be shown. We do that billions of times per day, resulting in millions of engagements with products that might otherwise not have been seen by shoppers.


The business and technical challenges are significant. Fortunately, we have a broad mandate to experiment and innovate, and a seemingly endless range of new opportunities to build a big, sustainable business that helps Amazon continuously innovate on behalf of all customers.

We're looking for customer-obsessed, innovative, professional data scientist who can help us take our products to the next level of functionality, quality and performance. We embrace leaders with a startup mentality — those who seek a disruptive yet clear mission and purpose, have an unambiguous owner's mindset, and are relentlessly obsessed with delivering amazing products.

Highly analytical: You solve problems in ways that can be backed up with verifiable data. You focus on driving processes, tools, and statistical methods which support rational decision-making.
Technically fearless: You aren't satisfied by performing 'as expected' and push the limits past conventional boundaries. Your dial goes to '11'.
Engaged by ambiguity: You're able to explore new problem spaces with unique constraints and non-obvious solutions.
Team obsessed individual contributor: You help grow your team members to achieve outstanding results. You've learned that big plans generally involve collaboration and great communications.
