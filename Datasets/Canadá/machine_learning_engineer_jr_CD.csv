Who we are:

http://www.rideco.com

RideCo powers on-demand transit. Public transit agencies use RideCo's cloud-based software platform to provide on-demand shared rides in dynamically routed buses and vans. Our clients include some of the world’s largest transportation operators such as Los Angeles Metro, Houston Metro, San Antonio Metro, and Calgary Transit.

Have you experienced getting frustrated with transfers and waiting while taking a public bus? Have you seen buses drive around in low-density areas with very few passengers on-board and wondered how inefficient that seems to be? You are likely aware of the first & last mile access challenges faced by transit hubs. We are solving these problems by re-imagining shared mobility. Imagine a world where vehicles have dynamic routes responsive to real-time trip demand. This 'dynamic shuttle' (or van /sedan) would pick you up, on-demand, at or near your doorstep, and take you to your destination or transit hub. Along the way, it may pick up other passengers going in your direction. Your experience will be seamless: less waiting, less walking, fewer transfers, shorter travel time, and timely pickups and drop-offs. RideCo's 'dynamic shuttle' platform enables this seamless experience and low-cost shared rides for vehicle fleet operators and their passengers. By seamlessly moving more people in fewer vehicles we are catalyzing a generational shift in how people get around cities and towns. This means commuters spend less time in transit and more time doing what they enjoy.

RideCo powers a diverse range of use cases, including residential/ suburban travel; first-mile-last-mile connections for transit hubs; and corporate employee transportation. We are investing to scale up and capture the growing demand for on-demand shared rides solutions.


RideCo is proud to be an equal opportunity employer, we are committed to building and supporting a culture of diversity, inclusion, and accessibility. We hire the best talent regardless of race, color, creed, national origin, ancestry, disability, marital status, age, veteran status, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, and expression.

We acknowledge that Bench headquarters is located on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the Coast Salish Peoples, including the territories of the xʷməθkwəy̓əm (Musqueam), Skwxwú7mesh (Squamish), and Səl̓ílwətaʔ/Selilwitulh (Tsleil-Waututh) Nations.

Businesses need to understand their financial performance, but for many smaller ones, this means a trade-off between managing their books and running their businesses.

Our mission is to make a profound difference in the quality of life of one million people. From creatives to chiropractors, Bench helps thousands of small business owners and entrepreneurs master their financial lives. Because understanding your finances should be three things: simple, effortless, and affordable.

We're growing fast, and we're looking for exceptional people to join us on this incredible journey. Check out our culture guide to learn more about what it's like to work at Bench and read more about our business here!

Dear future Benchmate,

There has never been a more exciting time to join Bench. We're on our way to make a profound difference in the quality of life of one million people.

Finance is inseparable from the human experience. Our personal finances influence our mental and physical wellbeing, where we live, our education, our family structures, and the opportunities we do or do not have. In the mind of a small business owner, there is no distinction between their business finances and their personal finances. Working at a Bench isn't about fintech; it's about making a difference in the quality of life of human beings.

Bench is already the biggest bookkeeper in North America—we currently have over 11,000 clients, and in 2020 alone we processed $21B in transactions—and we're just at the beginning of our technological journey.

We need help improving the internal tools for our developers to have the best experience. Our mission is improving our technology and processes to enhance the speed and quality of our engineering, with a strong focus on the reduction of technical debt. We're looking for intermediate software engineers who align with our mission of using technology to improve the lives of our Benchmates so they can build the tools to help our customers succeed. What we do is immensely creative; it requires us to fall in love with the problems we're tackling, and then challenge ourselves to resolve them with the simplest solutions we can dream up.

Here is an insight into this Intermediate Software Engineer position at Bench:

Do you enjoy debugging complex problems in code you did not write?
Are you comfortable with being on-call once per month for issues that are impacting our clients or Benchmates (we pay extra for this too)?
Do you seek efficiency through automation and tooling?
Does a slow or inefficient CI/CD pipeline frustrate you?
Does finding creative ways to configure and setup efficient and effective local development environments bring you joy?
Are you interested in dabbling in machine learning systems?
Are you someone who enjoys the speed, simplicity, and ease of working in a well architected AWS infrastructure?
Are you the type of person who is frustrated or inspired by technical debt that you want to pay it down and find ways to avoid it building up again?
Does finding or resolving security vulnerabilities in code, systems and services bring you joy and satisfaction?

If this aligns with your passion and career goals, then I look forward to meeting you and discussing how you can grow with us.

Sincerely,

Vee Weller
DXI Engineering Manager

WHAT YOU'LL DO:

Here's what you can expect on a typical day:

You'll start each day with a scrum, working in a team to understand responsibilities, identify issues, and communicate coding priorities while choosing user stories to complete. You will also participate in other agile ceremonies, including scheduled sprint demos, where you will present your work to up to 90 stakeholders.
Build teams that thrive. As an experienced leader, you want everyone to shine. You'll start each day by checking in with your engineering team to identify priorities and challenges. You'll find a way to make the team's day go smoother. You are constantly looking for ways to share your knowledge, motivate others and keep everyone engaged and productive.
Build Products. You will use your technical expertise to review your team's work and help your people excel in an Agile environment. You're proactive and hands-on. When you see a potential issue, you never leave things hanging and unfinished. When you and your team deliver a finished product, it's as polished as you could make it.
Variety of work. There is no typical day. You could be checking in with a team in India one minute, meeting with leadership to review initiatives for the coming quarter later and tomorrow handling a few ad hoc requests from your peers in other departments.
Influence and inspire confidence. You are comfortable presenting to senior leaders, product owners, and peers with a compelling voice that you demonstrate through executive presence, leading change, and creating clear executive-level communications on milestone achievements.
Experience. You have 5-8 years of experience in relevant skills gained and developed in the same or similar role.

You'll have a Bachelor's degree OR equivalent.
