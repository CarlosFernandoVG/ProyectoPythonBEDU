Senior Full Stack Engineer (Toronto or Vancouver Hub - Remote),Barley,British Columbia,Vancouver,-1,-1,,CAD,"About Barley

Compensation accounts for up to 70% of an organization’s total operating costs, yet the processes and tools used to determine who gets paid what, why, and how is still painfully convoluted and manual. How is this possible? Believe it or not, most companies are still using a dizzying amount of spreadsheets that ultimately leaves leadership guessing and the employees puzzled or worse yet, unfairly compensated.
Barley is a venture-backed startup focused on building solutions for a vast array of compensation challenges (from managing salary bands to conducting pay equity analysis). With Barley’s Compensation Management platform, our goal is to empower organizations to make better pay decisions.
Remote-First Across Two Hiring Hubs: Barley is a remote-first company that supports a flexible approach to work. Our team is co-located across two hiring hubs (Toronto and Vancouver).

Developing monitoring and observability strategies a PLUS
University degree in Computer Engineering/Science, or equivalent is a PLUS
Having experience building a product from the ground up and have launched new products to market is a PLUS
Experience in business-to-business (B2B) SaaS software is a PLUS
Haven’t worked with some of our specific technologies? No problem, a deep experience with web technologies and willingness to learn our tech stack goes a long way
Why You’ll Love Working at Barley
As an early member of the Barley team, you’ll play a key role in setting the stage for future employees
You’ll help push forward an important mission of driving more rational and equitable pay
You’ll have a piece of the pie - every Barley employee participates in our stock option plan
