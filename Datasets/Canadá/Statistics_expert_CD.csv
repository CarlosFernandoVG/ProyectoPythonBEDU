Consequence of Error/Judgement

The incumbent has responsibility to maintain a detailed understanding of complex loan, awards, and bursary policies and regulations, both those of UBC and federal/provincial government student financial assistance programs, and requires a comprehensive understanding of UBC s Endowment Management Policy (113) and Access to the University of British Columbia Policy (72) in order to provide accurate information to UBC staff, faculty and students and to make frequent evaluations regarding students eligibility to receive loan, award, and bursary funding. Failure to observe carefully internal and external policies and regulations and to adhere to the stated terms of loan, award, and bursary eligibility can have significant financial impact, and may also impact the relationship of the University with donors and provincial/federal government student aid programs. Failure to meet the conditions of an award established through a bequest could place the University in violation of the trust established by the donor s estate and error could result in the withdrawal of funding. If award set-up and assignment is not accurate and consistent with the guidelines established by the University and/or the award establishment form or terms of reference, students, staff and faculty may be misinformed and the award policies will be seen as unfair and inconsistent. Any errors and/or omissions in judgment could seriously undermine the roles, responsibilities and effectiveness of the University in student loans, awards, and bursary administration and may also incur reputation risk.

Duties
Provide professional editing and revision services (specifically involving review of grammar, style, syntax and readability, as well as factual accuracy and consistency within each draft and with the legislative corpus, and legistic and linguistic analysis) with respect to all aspects of legislative drafting in French of all federal government legislative texts (draft bills, regulations and other statutory instruments).
Work environment
Are you passionate about the French language? Do you have an excellent analytical mind? Do you like to learn and love a challenge? Why not consider legistic revision as the next step in your career?

What exactly is legistic revision?

Legistic revision deals with the content, style, language, readability and consistency of legislative texts. It’s therefore a very specific, and very interesting, field that focuses not only on the application of the rules of legal drafting, but also on the use of language skills (grammar, linguistics, etc.)

Who are legistic revisors?
Legistic revisors work in Department of Justice Canada’s Legislative Services Branch. They’re part of the large team of legislative counsel, jurilinguists, bijural experts and editors who work to produce legislative texts of the highest quality. Legislative texts aren’t mere deeds or contracts applicable to individuals; they’re laws and regulations that govern all of Canadian society. These texts are therefore of great importance and must be produced in accordance with established conventions and standards.


Continuing Education Program

Given the particularities of legislatic revision, some methods and knowledge can only be learned on the job. That is why, as a junior legislatic revisor, you’ll have access to personalized training programs and, above all, you’ll have the advantage of working closely with experienced Francophone and Anglophone legistic revisors who will be there to support you throughout your career. Moreover, there are several levels of positions, giving you exciting opportunities for career advancement with us (EC-04 Junior Legistic Revisor, EC 05 Legistic Revisor, EC-06 Legistic Revisor Team Leader and EC-07 Senior Legistic Revisor).

So, if you’re looking for a challenging and interesting career, don't wait! Join Justice Canada’s team of legistic revisors without delay.
