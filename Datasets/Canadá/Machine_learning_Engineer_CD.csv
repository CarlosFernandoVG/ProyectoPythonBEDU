Embodies our EAGER values—is ethical, adaptable, gritty, empathetic, and remarkable.
Is able to collaborate in person 2–4 weeks per quarter, traveling if necessary to the hub where the team is based.
Understands traditional machine learning algorithms and modern deep learning approaches as well.
Understands data structures and algorithms at a level sufficient to write performant code when working with large datasets or large incoming data streams.
Has experience with system design and building internal tools.
Is aware of NLP techniques to effectively work with very high-dimensional, sparse data.

Support for you, professionally and personally

Professional growth: We hire people we trust, and we give team members autonomy to do their best work. We also support professional development with training, coaching, and regular feedback.
A connected team: Grammarly builds a product that helps people connect, and we apply this mindset to our own team. We have a highly collaborative culture supported by our EAGER values. We also take time to celebrate our colleagues and accomplishments with global, local, and team-specific events and programs.
Comprehensive benefits: Grammarly offers all team members competitive pay along with a benefits package encompassing superior health care (including mental health benefits). We also offer support to set up a home office, ample and defined time off, gym and recreation stipends, and more.

We encourage you to apply

At Grammarly, we value our differences, and we encourage all—especially those whose identities are traditionally underrepresented in tech organizations—to apply.
