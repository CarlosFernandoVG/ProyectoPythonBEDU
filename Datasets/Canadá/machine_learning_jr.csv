"Data Scientist, Product Development",Praemo,Ontario,Kitchener,-1,-1,,CAD,"by Praemo | Sep 1, 2022
Praemo is searching for creative technical people to help improve Razor™. We do not require you to have all the qualifications listed in the following job description. A lot of what we do can be learned on the job. If this position sounds interesting to you, we strongly encourage you to apply!

About Praemo

Founded by industry experts, Praemo is focused on the appropriate application of leading-edge analytic technologies within industrial operations. We believe there is a simpler more effective way to harvest insights from the industrial and manufacturing datasets that already exist.

Utilizing an organization’s operational and IoT (Internet of Things) data as-is, where-is, and applying statistical, machine learning, and AI tools, Razor transforms existing and under-utilized data into context-relevant actionable insights. These insights alert industrial operators to any anomalous behavior with the potential to harm performance in time to prevent an incident. Due to the generalized nature of Razor, it can be applied to a wide range of datasets.

Praemo has worked with customer datasets that range from discrete manufacturing to consumer-packaged goods to mining and processing plants.

The Praemo head office is located in downtown Kitchener, Ontario, Canada. We are looking for an energetic applicant with general knowledge of Linux & Python to help us out. If you thrive in an autonomous, empowering, and exciting environment, and have a strong desire to learn and investigate new technologies, we want to hear from you!

About the Tech Team

The Tech Team is divided into two interacting branches: Product Development and Emerging Applications. The Product Development team focuses on the development of Razor and Razor’s model suite while the Emerging Applications team monitors the application of Razor to new customer data and develops new analytical approaches for emerging use cases. Both teams collaborate regularly to drive the product forward.

Successful Tech Team members are:

Adaptable
Hard-working
Motivated and self-starting
Creative
Can think critically about their code as well as the team’s
Can handle ambiguity

Overall, the Tech Team is dynamic with opportunities for everyone to contribute in a variety of ways. We run both Product Development and Emerging Applications Tech Teams as matrix organizations. Each team member is responsible for their own projects, with the entire team available for brainstorming and mentoring. We feel this structure allows you the freedom to create without the burden of micromanagement. We encourage taking ping-pong or coffee breaks and using all paid time off – a rested mind is an efficient mind!

The tech team also has plenty of opportunities to grow in whichever capacity you’re looking for. Want to upskill? Great! We have annual support for continuing education. Want to take on more responsibility and improve those leadership skills? Praemo will support your ambitions. Want to dip your feet in another team’s pool and learn something new? We’ll make it work! Want to see how many donuts you can eat in a day? Same. We’re in this together

About your role

At Praemo, the Tech Team works with data at massive scales and drives the development of our products. We work closely with our sales department and customers to shape the ongoing development of Razor. As a Data Scientist, you will have a direct impact on both our customers’ bottom line and our own.

Through model and utility development for Razor you will help provide actionable insights across all customers’ processes. In addition to your day-to-day tasks, you will also be expected to gain experience with the global system by contributing to other team-members’ projects in the form of code-review and brainstorming.

Responsibilities:

Build statistical or machine learning based solutions (descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, or prescriptive) while maintaining a generalized customer-centric point-of-view
Work closely with and incorporate feedback from internal Data Science and Sales teams
Actively participate in team-wide activities such as code review, brainstorming, and code quality assurance
Mentor Co-op Students and Junior Data Scientists

Formatting your resume to quantify your specific impact and initiative helps a lot:1. Please be specific about *what you did*. What actions or steps did you, personally, take?2. Please *quantify the impact* of your accomplishments. What was the outcome and impact that it had? How much did you personally contribute to the success of a project or task?3. e.g. Saying ""made the web server fast"" is not specific.4. Saying ""Increased server performance from 2 Requests Per Second (RPS) to 4,000 RPS"" is more specific. But _how_ did you do it?5. Saying ""Implemented redis LRU caching and optimized top 5 database queries to improve server performance from 2 RPS to 4,000 RPS"" - great! Now we know specifically what you did, and the impact it had. Fantastic.6. Please stack-rank your accomplishments so the best, most important, most impactful items are at the top. This makes it much easier to find the important, impactful accomplishments that demonstrate why you are great.-------About QuoteToMeAre you looking for a positive, collaborating team where you can make a big impact?

We acknowledge that Bench headquarters is located on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the Coast Salish Peoples, including the territories of the xʷməθkwəy̓əm (Musqueam), Skwxwú7mesh (Squamish), and Səl̓ílwətaʔ/Selilwitulh (Tsleil-Waututh) Nations.

Businesses need to understand their financial performance, but for many smaller ones, this means a trade-off between managing their books and running their businesses.

Our mission is to make a profound difference in the quality of life of one million people. From creatives to chiropractors, Bench helps thousands of small business owners and entrepreneurs master their financial lives. Because understanding your finances should be three things: simple, effortless, and affordable.

We're growing fast, and we're looking for exceptional people to join us on this incredible journey. Check out our culture guide to learn more about what it's like to work at Bench and read more about our business here!

Dear future Benchmate,

There has never been a more exciting time to join Bench. We're on our way to make a profound difference in the quality of life of one million people.

Finance is inseparable from the human experience. Our personal finances influence our mental and physical wellbeing, where we live, our education, our family structures, and the opportunities we do or do not have. In the mind of a small business owner, there is no distinction between their business finances and their personal finances. Working at a Bench isn't about fintech; it's about making a difference in the quality of life of human beings.

Bench is already the biggest bookkeeper in North America—we currently have over 11,000 clients, and in 2020 alone we processed $21B in transactions—and we're just at the beginning of our technological journey.

We need help improving the internal tools for our developers to have the best experience. Our mission is improving our technology and processes to enhance the speed and quality of our engineering, with a strong focus on the reduction of technical debt. We're looking for intermediate software engineers who align with our mission of using technology to improve the lives of our Benchmates so they can build the tools to help our customers succeed. What we do is immensely creative; it requires us to fall in love with the problems we're tackling, and then challenge ourselves to resolve them with the simplest solutions we can dream up.

Here is an insight into this Intermediate Software Engineer position at Bench:

Do you enjoy debugging complex problems in code you did not write?
Are you comfortable with being on-call once per month for issues that are impacting our clients or Benchmates (we pay extra for this too)?
Do you seek efficiency through automation and tooling?
Does a slow or inefficient CI/CD pipeline frustrate you?
Does finding creative ways to configure and setup efficient and effective local development environments bring you joy?
Are you interested in dabbling in machine learning systems?
Are you someone who enjoys the speed, simplicity, and ease of working in a well architected AWS infrastructure?
Are you the type of person who is frustrated or inspired by technical debt that you want to pay it down and find ways to avoid it building up again?
Does finding or resolving security vulnerabilities in code, systems and services bring you joy and satisfaction?

If this aligns with your passion and career goals, then I look forward to meeting you and discussing how you can grow with us.

Sincerely,

Vee Weller
DXI Engineering Manager
